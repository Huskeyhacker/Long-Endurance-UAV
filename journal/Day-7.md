Journal Entry 7 – Project Setup & Control System Planning

Date: 25,December,2025 (Day-8)

Today was mostly about setting things up properly instead of jumping straight into building or flying anything.

I finalized the basic project structure and documentation, including the first BOM.csv for Phase 1. For now, I’m only focusing on the transmitter and receiver. The goal is to understand how RC signals actually work before dealing with motors, batteries, or anything high-power.

I also made the first version of the quadrotor frame CAD in Fusion 360. This isn’t meant to be a final design. It’s more of a reference to think about layout, spacing, and how things might come together later. I expect this CAD to change a lot once I start testing electronics and figuring out real constraints.

Next, I want to power the receiver separately and connect it to a PC so I can start looking at raw channel data. From there, I’ll experiment with things like channel mapping, signal stability, latency, and how failsafes behave when the signal drops.

No flying planned at this stage. I want to reduce unknowns and actually understand what’s going on before moving forward.

Thanks for reading.
