CAD & Assembly Planning – Day 6

Spent today working on the physical side of the project instead of code. I made a full CAD model of the drone frame and assembled it to get a proper idea of scale, layout, and proportions before touching real hardware.

Designed a simple X-type frame in CAD with:

4 arms

top and bottom plates

full assembled view of the frame

I kept everything intentionally simple. No holes, no screws, no manufacturing details. The goal here wasn’t to design a custom carbon frame, but to plan the overall structure and see how everything fits together.

Exported the assembly and added screenshots + STL files to the repo so the layout is clear. Even with basic shapes, having the frame in CAD makes motor spacing, center area for the stack, and overall size way easier to reason about than just eyeballing specs.

This also made it obvious why CAD matters even if I end up buying a premade frame later. It’s more about planning the system than designing every single part.

Next I want to add simple placeholder blocks for things like the battery, stack, and camera so the assembly reflects the full system, not just the frame. After that, it’s back to control systems once hardware actually arrives.
