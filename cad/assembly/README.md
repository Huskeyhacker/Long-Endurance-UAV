## CAD Assembly

---
This folder contains the CAD files and views for the overall UAV frame and layout.
The goal of this assembly is to plan the physical structure and component spacing before building anything in real life.
---

The design here is intentionally simple and focuses on the overall geometry and layout rather than manufacturing-level details. Even though a premade frame may be used later, this assembly helps visualize how the system fits together and avoids guesswork during the build.
---

The files may change as the project progresses and the design gets refined.
